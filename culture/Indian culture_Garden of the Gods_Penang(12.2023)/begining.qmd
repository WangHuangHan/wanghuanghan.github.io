Malaysia is located at the intersection of the East and West, including Chinese, Islamic, Indian, and Western cultures. If you are interested in ancient culture as I do, Malaysia would be a great fit.

In this article, I will share a 2-day (09.12.23-10.12.23) Indian culture forum and Hinduism temple guided tour at George Town, Penang (Malaysia).

Before the story starts, I want to give credit to the lecturer, Mr. Tang Ah Chai (陳亞才), the organizer [Penang City Eye 城視報](https://facebook.com/PgCityEye) & [Penang Harmony Corporation](https://facebook.com/harmonico.my), and the participants.

Cultural activities and engagement are always interesting to me. Since childhood, my eyes have been caught by vivid cultural things such as Chinese, Indian, Indonesian, Malaysian, and Islamic cultures. With the background and foundation of Chinese culture, it immensely strengthens my understanding and appreciation of other cultures.

In the Chinese ancient classic "[I-Ching](https://www.chinesethought.cn/EN/shuyu_show.aspx?shuyu_id=2283) (The Book of Changes)," it said, "觀乎天文，以察時變；觀乎人文，以化成天下。," means that by observing the movement of constellations, we can learn about the change of seasons; by observing development of human culture, we can enlighten the people and build a civilized society.


## Introduction
Malaysia is a multi-ethnic country, with 60% of the population being Malays (nearly 20 million), almost 22.6% Chinese (around 6 million), and 7% Indians (about 2 million), with 90% of Indian ancestors coming from Tamil Nadu and the rest being aboriginals and other ethnic groups.

After this brief overview of the population proportion in Malaysia, let's dive into the topic "Immersing Indian Culture - Garden of Gods."

## Impressive Part
### Cultural Forum
Indian culture, over 5000 years old and undergoing the test of time, has transformed into a colorful and unique characteristic. Each state in India has its solid and vivid features. When people dive more into it, they will find much more they don't know about India. To echo the adage "You don't know what you don't know" found in [Indian Market Characteristics](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/indian-market-characteristics-ravindra-vasisht/) by Ravindra Vasisht, let's begin with the colorful culture about India.

After learning and participating in these two days of fulfilling courses and guided tours, it was like experiencing an in-depth SPA of Indian culture. From the first day, teacher Tang Ah Chai structurally talked about the origin of Indian culture (the origin of civilization, the caste system, etc.) to wonderful classics and epics (Mahabharata, Ramayana). Then, we can find that the entire Southeast Asia and East Asia are deeply influenced by Indian cultures, such as the shadow puppet show Wayang kulit in Malaysia and Indonesia, the Ramakien in Thailand, and the well-known novel Journey to the West (西遊記) in Chinese culture.

In addition, the Vedic classics, the Puranas, the Upanishads (the unification of Atman and Brahman), and the Aranyaka (like the Indian version of career planning), teacher Tang using a life-oriented narrative style, which makes me interested in finding time to dig these Hindu classics gradually.

### Guided Tour
The most exciting part is the guided tour of the Indian temples and museum. At this time, "the Chettiar ethnic group," who came to Malaysia from India and mainly engaged in traders, weaving, agricultural, and land-owning businesses, came to my mind deeply.

:::

Not only did I visit the Penang Indian Heritage Museum to understand the united force of the Chettiar family, but I also saw as many as 20 lunch boxes taller than ordinary people, which was enough to show the enormous family during that time.

Different color powders have different meanings:

- White: The most universal color symbolizing liberation and freedom from reincarnation reminds everyone that people will eventually be reborn and burned into ashes after cremation, just like this white ashes.

- Red: The red dot symbolizing love and bravery not only represents married women, but its symbolic meaning is to protect women and their husbands from harm and destruction of their intimate relationships from the evil eye.

- Yellow: The yellow dot made from turmeric powder can be applied on the forehead and the whole body. It has a cooling effect and can calm the mind. The yellow dot also symbolizes wealth.

- Holy Water: Priests will give prayers after pooja/puja (offering) to symbolize blessing and bring fortune. Normally, prayers use their right hand to hold and drink holy water.

Visiting Nagarathar Kovil Veedu to understand the history and process of the Chettiar people.  
:::

The most impressive thing was the visit to Nagarathar Kovil Veedu on the second day, which allowed us to communicate directly with Mr. Shiva, the person in charge of Penang Nagarathar Sivan Temple. He mentioned that their ancestors came to Malaysia with the golden Vel (spear) of lord Murugan. They always remember that the wealth earned is ultimately used to worship the gods. From a few minutes of interviews, I understand that Chettiar is good at doing business and providing loans, and is well-known for their honesty and trust.

Although the Chettiar family is no longer engaged in business lending as the primary industry in the past, it is scattered in various fields. Some are lawyers, doctors, software and hardware engineers, professors (teachers), etc. You can feel that Chettiar people are proud of their identity and reveal some confidence and pride.

Nowadays, they added that there are still people who come to them for loans, some to pay tuition or to buy a house. The symbolic meaning is greater than the substantive meaning, hoping to bring them good luck, such as the Chinese "The arrival of good fortune (bat 福到)" are also the most exciting parts of the conversation.

## Key Takeaways
**The more you know about India, the more you don't know!**

It is worth participating in this cultural activity with teacher Tang Ah Chai's detailed explanation, which makes the intricate Indian culture easy to understand and accessible to everyone of all ages.

- To conclude, through this 2-day Indian cultural activity (Garden of Gods), I realized how possible it is to break the race barriers between others. The key is to understand different cultures and respect each other.

- In the end, all of us were blessed and embarked on the next journey in our life.
