## Introduction

The story all starts from here, in east Malaysia Borneo island. In Chinese, there is an old quote saying that "Â§©Âú∞ÊúâÂ§ßÁæéËÄå‰∏çË®Ä" by the Chinese philosopher Zhuangzi, which means the universe and the mother earth have their natural beauty, but they won't say any word to others. There is such a word in English: Extraordinary meaning beyond normal and surpassing ordinary. Also, in Bahasa Melayu, "Luarbiasa" contains the same meaning: luar means further away, and biasa means ordinary.

The first time I visited the tropical rainforest, I was amazed by the **HUGE** things there. For instance, anything is big here: trees, leaves, flowers, fruits, and creatures (like ants, orangutans, birds, and so on). My 5-day rainforest journey, organized by [Society of Wilderness Malaysia](https://facebook.com/sowmorg), began from the *1st to 5th March 2023*, and this also motivates me to engage more in nature conservation efforts.


## Insights

There are many beautiful parts of the Malaysian rainforest. In this article, I am going to talk about three parts: "Tree Canopy," "Creatures," and "My Observation."

Malaysia is well known for its rich biodiversity. Let's be ready and dive into it together!

### Tree Canopy

When it comes to rainforests, the lungs of the earth and the "broccoli" tree pop up in my mind. 

![Canopy Walkway in RDC @Sepilok, Malaysia](image2.jpg){#fig-CanopyWalk width=60%}

Usually, the tree structure of a rainforest can be divided into emergents, canopy, under canopy, and shrub layers. Thus, most reserve areas set up a canopy walkway to make it easier for people to observe nature; as Figure 2 displays, the trunks of the trees are typically thin in the rainforest. Let me give a quick overview of the Rainforest Discovery Center (RDC) in Sepilok. Situated on the edge of the Kabili-Sepilok Forest Reserve in Sandakan, RDC has been operating since 1996, focusing on environmental education. Today, it's a 3-in-1 park catering to wildlife, bird, and plant enthusiasts, offering a glimpse of Borneo's distinctive biodiversity for nature lovers and bird watchers.

:::

There are some interesting points to note from Figure 3. Tropical canopies, reaching heights of up to over 50 meters (about 16-17 floors high), showcase their competitive nature in absorbing sunlight for rapid growth. This is reflected in their thin trunks, making them become giant umbrella-like forms. The canopy layer, constituting the second rainforest level, serves as a shield, intercepting light penetrating from the emergent layer above. Approximately 75-98% of light is absorbed here, effectively blocking it from reaching the lower layers.

Moreover, the canopy layer acts as a natural reservoir, capturing most rainfall, which limits the amount that reaches the plants in the lower strata. Therefore, life predominantly thrives in this layer, while vegetation below relies on the scant rainfall that trickles down from above.

### Unique Creatures

Biodiversity is undoubtedly amazing in Malaysia, which is also the most exciting part of this nature observation journey. In the following, I will show some pictures of signature creatures. As I was using binoculars as my second eye to enjoy the beauty of nature, it would be more engaging to look through from my point of view and describe how amazing it is in this beautiful heaven.

The Kinabatangan River (Malay: Sungai Kinabatangan) stands as Malaysian second-longest river, stretching across 560 kilometers from its origins in the southwest Sabah mountains to its convergence with the Sulu Sea, east of Sandakan. This region is renowned for its remarkable biodiversity, boasting a rich tapestry of natural wonders, including limestone caves nestled in Gomantong Hill, expansive dryland dipterocarp forests, lush riverine and freshwater swamp forests, picturesque oxbow lakes, and the brackish mangrove swamps hugging the coastal areas.

We spent two days on the Kinabatangan River to observe the unique creatures in Malaysia. The first two superstars, the orangutan and proboscis monkey, are well known worldwide and stand as symbols for Malaysia. I will showcase the pictures of these two creatures in the conservation area to compare each other.

Hornbills are known as Malaysia National Birds. There are 10 species of hornbills found in Malaysia, and they typically come together as a couple. The Borneo elephant is found on the island of Borneo in Malaysia. They are a type of Asian elephant, but smaller in size, about half the size of an Asian elephant. Borneo elephants inhabit tropical rainforests and swampy areas, feeding on leaves, grass, and fruits.

Sunda flying lemur and Tarsier are both arboreal creatures, living in trees, and being nocturnal in their activities.

Sun bears, also called the 'Malayan Sun bear,' are the smallest member of the bear family with a long tongue and experience in climbing trees. They lumber through the forests by night, snacking on fruits, berries, roots, insects, small birds, lizards, and rodents.

From what I heard from Calvin Soh, the President of the Society of Wilderness Malaysia, we can find more than 20 species of kingfishers across Malaysia if we keep putting effort into observing nature.

Both images were taken during food time, and orangutans and proboscis monkeys were conserved in the reserved area.

By contrast, it is more exciting for me to observe the animals in the wild since we have to be focused and enjoy every moment when doing a safari. I noticed that wild animals, such as orangutans and proboscis monkeys, are more active and lively than those in the conversation area. Most importantly, wild animals grow bigger than animals in conserved regions.

To sum up, rich biodiversity is the only word that pops up in my mind, and many pictures are still stored on my device and memorized in my mind. Thus, rainforests and canopies play an essential role in their habitat. One of the purposes of writing this article is to raise awareness among the public and be informed of the beauty of nature.

### My Observation
#### **Deforestation in Borneo Island**
After those lovely animals, let's discuss some serious issues as I try to engage more in this topic. Unavoidably, when it comes to global warming, trees and forests often come to the discussion table. 

There are some significant data to show.

![Deforestation in Borneo (hectares). source from Rhett A. Butler online](image17.jpg){#fig-deforestation width=70%}

In Malaysia, the primary forest and tree cover data showcases distinct perspectives on forest landscapes. The primary forest cover in 2001 stood at 10,611,815 hectares, whereas by 2020, it had declined to 8,708,737 hectares, indicating a significant loss of 1,903,078 hectares or approximately 17.9%. This reduction is a cause for concern, representing a considerable portion of Malaysia's original forested areas.

Conversely, when assessing the broader tree cover across Malaysia, the figures reflect a similar trend but encompass a larger expanse. In 2001, the total tree cover was noted at 18,164,118 hectares, which then diminished to 15,243,971 hectares by 2020, revealing a loss of 4,403,860 hectares or around 24.2% over the period between 2002 and 2019.

The primary forest remains undisturbed, vital for biodiversity and ecosystem stability, while tree cover includes disturbed areas like logged or altered land. Deforestation due to agriculture, logging, and urbanization primarily affects primary forests. Yet, changes in tree cover may involve reforestation or secondary growth, offsetting some losses. Distinguishing between them is crucial: primary forest loss poses an immediate threat to ecosystems, needing targeted conservation. Meanwhile, broader tree cover changes encompass various land use shifts, demanding comprehensive forest management strategies. Both are vital for understanding forest dynamics and their impact on biodiversity and the environment.

## Summary

Malaysia is uniquely blessed. It is located at the intersection of East and West, including Chinese, Islamic, Indian, and Western cultures. There are many cultural and natural resources around here.

Nature is our teacher. We live here, grow here and learnig from mother earth.
